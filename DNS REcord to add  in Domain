Perfect 👍 I’m glad it’s working now.
What you posted is almost textbook-correct for cPanel email. I’ll clearly explain:

Which records are IMPORTANT

Which are OPTIONAL / auto-created

What you must always have when creating email in the future

Save this as your reference ✅

✅ REQUIRED (MUST-HAVE) RECORDS FOR CPANEL EMAIL

These are the core records. Without them, email will not work.

1️⃣ MX record (MOST IMPORTANT)
Type: MX
Host: @
Points to: mail.dlbwebservice.com
Priority: 0


✔ Tells the world where to deliver your email
✔ You already have this — correct

2️⃣ Mail server A record
Type: A
Host: mail
Points to: 185.195.12.114


✔ The MX record must point to something that resolves
✔ Required

3️⃣ SPF (anti-spam, REQUIRED)
Type: TXT
Host: @
Value: v=spf1 a mx ip4:185.195.12.114 ~all


✔ Prevents spam / improves delivery
✔ Correct

4️⃣ DKIM (email authentication)
Type: TXT
Host: default._domainkey
Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=...


✔ Cryptographically signs outgoing mail
✔ Auto-generated by cPanel
✔ Correct

5️⃣ DMARC (policy + reputation)
Type: TXT
Host: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none


✔ Controls how receivers handle failures
✔ Correct (you can tighten later)

✅ REQUIRED FOR WEBMAIL & LOGIN (NORMAL)

These make webmail and email clients work smoothly.

A  webmail   → 185.195.12.114
A  autoconfig → 185.195.12.114
A  autodiscover → 185.195.12.114


✔ Used by Outlook / Thunderbird / mobile auto-setup
✔ Correct

✅ HOSTING / CPANEL SYSTEM RECORDS (LEAVE THEM)

These are normal and should NOT be deleted:

A  cpanel
A  whm
A  webdisk
A  localhost (127.0.0.1)


✔ Internal + management
✔ Safe

✅ OPTIONAL / CONVENIENCE RECORDS
CNAME ftp → dlbwebservice.com
CNAME www → dlbwebservice.com
SRV _autodiscover._tcp → cpanelemaildiscovery.cpanel.net


✔ Not required for mail delivery
✔ Helpful for clients
✔ Safe to keep

🟢 SUMMARY TABLE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Record	Required	Status
MX	✅ MUST	✔ Correct
mail A record	✅ MUST	✔ Correct
SPF	✅ MUST	✔ Correct
DKIM	✅ MUST	✔ Correct
DMARC	✅ MUST	✔ Correct
autoconfig / autodiscover	⚠️ Recommended	✔ Correct

👉 Your DNS is now clean and correct for cPanel email

🧠 WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW EMAIL ACCOUNT

You DO NOT add new DNS records each time.

Just do:

cPanel → Email Accounts → Create


DNS stays the same.

🔒 OPTIONAL NEXT IMPROVEMENT (LATER)

When everything is stable, you can improve DMARC:

v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:info@dlbwebservice.com


(Not required now.)

If you want, next I can help you:

Configure WP Mail SMTP properly

Improve email deliverability

Secure email against spoofing
