Perfect! Here’s a step-by-step guide to fully manage info@dlbwebservice.com inside your Gmail account, so you can both receive and send emails as if it were a Gmail account.

Step 1: Make sure Gmail can fetch your emails (POP3)

Log in to your Gmail account (your main Gmail).

Go to Settings → See all settings → Accounts and Import → Check mail from other accounts → Add a mail account.

Enter info@dlbwebservice.com and click Next.

Choose Import emails from my other account (POP3) and click Next.

Fill in the POP settings:

Username: info@dlbwebservice.com

Password: your email password

POP server: mail.dlbwebservice.com

Port: 110 (or 995 if SSL)

Check “Leave a copy of retrieved messages on the server” ✅

Check “Label incoming messages” and assign a label like info@dlbwebservice.com ✅

Click Add Account.

✅ Gmail will now fetch incoming emails from info@dlbwebservice.com and organize them under the label you selected.

Step 2: Set up Gmail to send as info@dlbwebservice.com (SMTP)

Still in Settings → Accounts and Import → Send mail as → Add another email address.

Enter your name and info@dlbwebservice.com as the email.

Uncheck “Treat as an alias” if you want replies to go directly to this email.

Click Next Step.

Enter the SMTP settings:

SMTP Server: mail.dlbwebservice.com

Port: 587 (or 465 if SSL)

Username: info@dlbwebservice.com

Password: your email password

Use TLS or SSL depending on your server settings

Click Add Account. Gmail will send a verification email to your info@dlbwebservice.com inbox.

Open Roundcube or your webmail, get the verification code, and enter it in Gmail.

✅ Now you can send emails from Gmail as info@dlbwebservice.com.

Step 3: Organize your emails

Gmail will apply the label you selected in Step 1, so all emails from info@dlbwebservice.com are easy to find.

You can also create filters, archive, or apply additional labels.

Step 4: Optional – Make it seamless

You can set this account as default when sending new emails from Gmail:
Settings → Accounts and Import → Send mail as → Make default.

Use Gmail mobile apps to access all your emails in one place.

✅ Result:

You can read and reply to info@dlbwebservice.com emails entirely in Gmail.

Emails are stored both in Gmail and (optionally) on the original server.

You don’t need a Google account for info@dlbwebservice.com to manage it in Gmail.
