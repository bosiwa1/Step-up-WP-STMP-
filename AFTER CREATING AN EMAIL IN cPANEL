✅ AFTER CREATING AN EMAIL IN cPANEL
(Email Routing – VERY IMPORTANT)
🔹 STEP 1 — Go to Email Routing

In cPanel:

Email → Email Routing


Select your domain:

dlbwebservice.com

🔹 STEP 2 — Choose the CORRECT Option

You will see 4 options:

Local Mail Exchanger

Remote Mail Exchanger

Backup Mail Exchanger

Automatically Detect Configuration

✅ Correct choice for cPanel email:
✅ Local Mail Exchanger


📌 Why?

Your mailbox exists on this server

Mail must be delivered locally to cPanel

🔹 STEP 3 — Save

Click:

Change


You should see:

Success: The email routing configuration has been updated.

🔹 STEP 4 — MX Record MUST Match

Your MX record should be:

Host: @
Priority: 0
Destination: mail.dlbwebservice.com


✔ You already have this — GOOD

🔹 STEP 5 — Verify Mail Server Hostname

In cPanel:

Server Information → Server Hostname


It should look like:

mail.dlbwebservice.com


or

server.yourhost.com


✔ Either is OK as long as MX points to mail.dlbwebservice.com

🚫 COMMON MISTAKES (AVOID THESE)

❌ Selecting Remote Mail Exchanger
→ Email will NEVER arrive in cPanel inbox

❌ Leaving old Titan / Google MX records
→ Mail goes to wrong provider

❌ Multiple MX records from different providers
→ Random delivery failures
